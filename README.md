# Onegin

The programme is free-to-use for all kinds of developers.
### What does the project do
***
Sorts text from the file in lexicographical order from the beginning and from the end and then inputs both sorted variants and the original text to another file.

### Why is the project useful
***
Sometimes we need to sort some text in lexicographical order, so this programmme does this.

### How to work with
***
This programme should be used in cmd. You go to the directory where main.cpp, Onegin.cpp and Sorting.cpp are and then you are to write these lines (in line that begins with main.exe you can write -help to get some information and help):

g++.exe main.cpp Onegin.cpp Sorting.cpp -o main.exe
main.exe  

Then just follow the instructions of the programme.
### How can I help
